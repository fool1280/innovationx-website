            The Human Bio-Behavioral Signals (HUBBS) lab at the department of Computer 
            Science & Engineering focuses on computational models of human behavior from multimodal 
            signals, including audiovisual and physiological indices. In this project, the HUBBS/CSCE 
            team is working on processing and analyzing physiological signals from performance tasks 
            under different noise conditions. The team is further designing machine learning models 
            to automatically estimate one's stress, mood, perceived workload, and performance from the 
            collected signals.

            We focus on smart building and data-driven human-building interaction for examining the 
            effect of built environments to occupants’ environmental comfort and work performance. 
            In this project, the auralization-based acoustic simulation is conducted in a virtual 
            environment, which explores the real-time dynamic interaction between noise and human 
            stress/performance in a virtual scene.

              Our conjecture is that reconfiguring the geometrical shapes of the kerf panel will 
              allow adaptive tuning of the room acoustics, which will be explored in this project. 
              In order to fulfill it, our focus is to design intelligent and reconfigurable kerf 
              panels that can vary the acoustics in the room to achieve personalized space. We are 
              specifically studying the modal response of adaptive and compliant kerf structures. 
              After understanding the modal response, we study acoustic wave propagation through 
              these kerf structures using numerical wave based models.
